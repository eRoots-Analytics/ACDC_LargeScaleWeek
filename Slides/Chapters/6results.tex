\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
 
    \textcolor{green}{\ding{51}} A generalised power flow formulation has been demonstrated that solves both AC and DC systems, benchmarked against GridCal's classical method.

    \textcolor{green}{\ding{51}} The proposed solver reliably converges in our test cases and the solution shows strong accuracy to the classical method.

    \textcolor{green}{\ding{51}} The generalised approach enables solving systems where classical methods fail, such as the modified AC/DC IEEE 118-bus system.
   
    \textcolor{green}{\ding{51}} The solver scales efficiently, maintaining a linear relationship between system size and the number of iterations required for convergence.

\begin{frame}{Impact}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed a robust and scalable approach for solving AC/DC systems.
        \item Implemented the solution in an open-source format, accessible to everyone.
        \item Preparing a research paper for upcoming conferences to share findings.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Future Work}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Incorporation of Current Limits for VSCs}: 
        To begin considering the capability curves of the converters and perform checks during iterations to adjust setpoints when limits are reached.

        \item \textbf{Code Optimization}: 
        To optimize the handling of large-scale mismatch matrices and Jacobians, focusing on reducing computational complexity, especially when dealing with sparse matrices.

        \item \textbf{Common Compiler for Control Schemes}: 
        To align the differences in control schemes for VSCs and controllable transformers between the current GridCal models and the generalised formulation. This will extend GridCalâ€™s capabilities and ensure logical control scheme integration from a power systems perspective.
